# [Blade Syntax for PHP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=namesmt.blade-php)

##### Highly recommend to install: [Blade Color](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=namesmt.blade-color)
> Unfortunately, Tabnine is recommended for now instead of the amazing Intelephense, as Intelephense doesn't support auto-complete for `Blade` blocks (`{{ }}`) yet


Blade syntax highlight support **for (in) `PHP`**.
> Use with Language Mode: `PHP`, so others `PHP` exts should work ([Intelephense](https://github.com/NamesMT/blade-php/blob/HEAD/vscode:extension/bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client),...etc)

> Additionally, switch to Language Mode: `Blade` to highlight only `Blade` (and `PHP` inside of Blade) syntaxes

Todo:
* Add keyboard shortcut to switch between PHP and Blade Language Mode
* When [#53885](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885) [#68647](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68647) is solved, we can:
    + Enable/Disable the syntax in real-time, as well as a shortcut for it.
* **Your ideas?** (submit an github issue)

## Features

## Blade Syntax Highlight

* Injected to PHP Language Mode!, just open any extension of `PHP` file
* Switch language mode to `Blade` (`Ctrl + K, M` or `âŒ˜   K, M`)
    + Will leaves only `Blade` and it's sub-`PHP` codes to be highlighted, useful to debug/nav around large `@blade methods`
